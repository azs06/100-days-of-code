# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript canvas on create a painting app.

**Thoughts:** Working with html5 canvas api is always fun, learned few things about canvas api, I plan to create a video game using html5 canvas api, also will make this paint application real time drawing board with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [express.js](http://expressjs.com) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io).

### Day 1: January 02, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Added express server and socket.io on paint app.

**Thoughts:** Learned few things about socket.io, used express only for creating server, nothing fancy. It's now a collaborative paint app, there are few bugs that needs to fixed, there are lots of coding improvement could be done.

### Day 6: January 07, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on 'Hold Shift to select checkboxes' from javascript 30 by Wes Bos.

**Thoughts:** Figuring out the best way to solve any problem is harder then writing code, if you can solve something even with pseudo code then you can code it to any lang.

### Day 7: January 10, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Back at coding outside work, after two sick days, worked on a Pokemon move search app using fetch api. Improvement needs to be added*.

**Thoughts:** It's hard to work while you are not at your best, but we have to rise above all obstacles to achieve our goal. Fetch api seems great, though I would still prefer to use something like axios for larger application.

### Day 8: January 11, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on some coding exercise at checkio(javascript).

**Thoughts:** Solving problem is essential skill for a programmer, the more you practice the better you become at it.
