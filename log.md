# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 01, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Worked on JavaScript canvas on create a painting app.

**Thoughts:** Working with html5 canvas api is always fun, learned few things about canvas api, I plan to create a video game using html5 canvas api, also will make this paint application real time drawing board with [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), [express.js](http://expressjs.com) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io).

### Day 1: January 02, 2017


**Today's Progress**: Added express server and socket.io on paint app.

**Thoughts:** Learned few things about socket.io, used express only for creating server, nothing fancy. It's now a collaborative paint app, there are few bugs that needs to fixed, there are lots of coding improvement could be done.
